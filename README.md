# minivi

This project has been completely moved to https://altlinux.space/aleksandershad/minivi

A small application for viewing images.

Everything is minimalistic.

Functionality:

- closing the application by pressing Esc / Q / Ctrl + Q
- opening images, both when associating files and from the application by pressing Ctrl + O / O
- setting an image as a desktop background by pressing W
- information about the image I
- deleting an image by pressing Del / D
- calling help by pressing F1
- switch images using arrows or the right/left mouse button
- zoom/unzoom using the mouse wheel, or +/- (may not work in tiling)

To support working with the webp format, `libwebp-tools` must be installed on the system.

[![Example of use in tiling and normal mode](./res/preview.webp)](./res/preview.mp4)

The application uses an icon (image) by the author **Cosmin Negoita** under the license **"Free for commercial use"**
